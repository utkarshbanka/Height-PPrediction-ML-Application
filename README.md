# Hight-PPrediction-ML-Application
This project leverages machine learning to predict an individual’s height based on physical attributes such as shoe size, arm weight, age, and leg length. By analyzing these features from the training dataset, the model learns underlying patterns and provides accurate height predictions for new inputs.

# Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore trends and correlations
Implementation of multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge) for comparison
Model evaluation using performance metrics (R² Score, MAE, MSE)
Model saving using Pickle/Joblib
Web app integration (Flask/Streamlit) for real-time prediction

# Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Deployment: Flask/Streamlit 
Model Storage: Pickle/Joblib
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for training

# Use Cases

Healthcare – Forecasting children’s growth patterns and identifying abnormalities early.
Sports & Fitness – Monitoring athlete development and optimizing training based on growth trends.
Genetics Research – Studying the impact of hereditary and lifestyle factors on human height.
Clothing & Retail – Predicting accurate body measurements for size recommendations and better fitting.

Education & Research Projects – Practical use for learning regression models, deployment, and real-world applications.
